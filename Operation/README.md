# Operation Assesments
In order to complete the Operation Problems,we will be Using Tick Stack which is a collection of products
from the developers of the time-series database InfluxDB. It is made up of the following components:
```
  -Telegraf collects time-series data from a variety of sources.
  -InfluxDB stores time-series data.
  -Chronograf visualizes and graphs the time-series data.
  -Kapacitor provides alerting and detects anomalies in time-series data.
```

each of these components separately, but if you use them together, you'll have a scalable, integrated 
open-source system for processing time-series data.The KEYWORDS of the problem #1 are database and 
access log and for the problem #2 it is simply Monitoring, and BINGO!!!
we are going to collect metrics from the system resources and services(webServer included) and make 
dashboards and graphs to monitor our system. let's first address the Problem #2.
